TempomailUSA solves this by providing **instant, temporary inboxes** that can be used for:

- Website registrations  
- App and service trials  
- Verification codes (OTP)  
- Testing email workflows  
- Preventing spam and tracking  

There is **no registration**, **no personal data collection**, and **no long-term storage**.
